## Hi, my name is Nick!
> I am a builder of systems who seeks to truly understand all that I do, and all that I create. Leveraging my background in Environmental Science and systems level thinking I am able to see the sum of complex interactions, and how my work fits into that complexity. I pursue information with tenacity when dealing with tough challenges to acquire deep knowledge on the obstacle. This is why I have creative ways of seeing answers to problems; I see them from every angle. I bring true motivation and a clear moral compass to everything that I do and every organization I am a part of.
